Multiple Instance Learning tracker
---------------------------------

This code is an implementation of the MilTrack algorithm [1]. It is based on the [original code](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~bbabenko/project_miltrack.html) of Boris Babenko, but was updated to use OpenCV 3.x, to use CMake for compiling the code, and to integrate the [TraX protocol](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax) for easier evaluation.
